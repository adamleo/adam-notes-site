**Optimistic:**
Don't save money

**Pessimistic:**
Save money (China: 30% GDP saved <2013>)

**Determinate:**
High investment rate (have specific things to invest in)

**Indeterminate:**
Low investment rate (don't know what to invest in)

## Indeterminate Optimism:
Low saving, low investment rate

No one's thinking and everyone's outsourcing the thinkingto other people

### Determinate Optimism:
i.e.
- The construction of the Transcontinental Railroad in the 19th century
- Robert Moses, powerful New Yorker, built lots of roads, stopped when people stopped believing in the future

More people are creating things, like pursuing careers in engineering & art.

People have dreams of the future that they are willing to work towards even if nobody shares.

### Determinate Pessimistic:
Wartime rationing

### Indeterminate Pessimistic:
Buying insurance. Education bubble: people don't know what's education for, but they take it as a form of insurance.

### Indefinite Optimism:

Portfolio investing theory: invest in stock index

Strange things happen from definite to indefinite views of the future, people shift from engineering to finance, money becomes much more important

in a definite world, money is a means to an end, you have things to do with money. In an indefinite world, you have no idea what to do with money, some money becomes an end in itself

Big companies invest their money (in a portfolio of stocks, avoid single stocks to avoid having opinions/ideas, that's dangerous) to generate free cash flows.

Like invest in companies that are losing money instead of making money, because the companies that are not profitable are actually the companies that have lots of ideas about what to do with their money. Massively profitable companies are the ones out of ideas.

It's a closed loop, nobody is doing anything valuable with the money, it's completely abstracted, and you end up with fewer and fewer things to do.

Buffet is in an indefinite pessimism view of the world, that's why he's shifting his investments to insurance companies.
